This app now uses environment variables to store the gitHub token for use with the gitHub API.

The general structure is based off of a pair lab assignment in our course, but showcases my abilities as a developer.

This site utilizes client-side routing. It's a bit of overkill for the size of my portfolio, because we don't really need the performance gain, but I wanted to show that I can implement it in a single page app.

I have built this site to be responsive. Initially, I wanted to force myself to learn Skeleton with this project, which I did to an extent, but I realized that the site is so minimalistic, that Skeleton was more of a hindrance than a help.

You should be able to see the CSS media query take effect at 640 pixels, more as an exercise than being necessary for this page in its current form.
